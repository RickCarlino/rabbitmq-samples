RabitMQ Examples
================

Simple examples of [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com) usage via the Ruby [Rabbit gem](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/bunny).

Running the Examples
--------------------

A simple `bundle install` followed by `ruby <filename>` should be all you need.

If you have not already done so, you may wish to consider installing the [RabbitMQ Management Plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html). It's a great way to visualize RabbitMQ.
